## Insights for Presentation

There are two types of users which are customer and subscribe. I found out that the average trip length of customer is 15 minutes and the average trip length of subscribe is 9 minutes. Since I split people into different age group, I calculated the average trip length of each age group. The average trip length of people at 60-70 years old and 100 to 110 years old are 12 minutes. This result may not correspond to the real situation. I calculate the number of users in each age group. Most peopleâ€™s years old are younger than 60. There are 68763 users at 30 to 40 years old.
