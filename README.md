In this course, I completed 5 projects in total.

I learned the data analysis process by finishing first three projects, which are questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Besides, I learned how to work with data in Python using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

After finishing Analyze  A/B Test results project, I learned how to apply inferential statistics and probability to important, real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

I learned data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data and how to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for deeper analysis by finishing Wrangle and Analyze Data project.

According to Communicate Data Findings project, I know how to apply sound design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process and how to use analysis and visualizations to tell a story with data.
